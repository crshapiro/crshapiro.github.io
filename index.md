I am an energy engineer who works to mitigate global climate change through efficient use of renewable energy. I am currently a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow in the U.S. Department of Energy Building Technologies Office. As a postdoctoral fellow and doctoral student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, I worked under Professors [Dennice Gayme](http://engineering.jhu.edu/gayme/) and [Charles Meneveau](http://pages.jh.edu/~cmeneve1/) to develop wind energy models and control algorithms to increase wind energy integration in electric power systems.
