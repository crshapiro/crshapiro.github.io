I am an energy engineer who works to mitigate global climate change through efficient use of renewable energy and a lover of trees, plants, nature, and I am currently a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow in the U.S. Department of Energy Building Technologies Office. As a postdoctoral fellow and doctoral student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, I worked to develop wind energy models and control algorithms to increase wind energy integration in electric power systems.
