I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Mechanical Engineering working under Professors [Dennice Gayme](http://engineering.jhu.edu/gayme/) and [Charles Meneveau](http://pages.jh.edu/~cmeneve1/) at the Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on developing vortex models for wind turbine aerodynamics, wind turbine wake models, and wind wind farm control algorithms to increase wind energy integration in electric power systems.
