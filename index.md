I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering working under Professors [Dennice Gayme](http://engineering.jhu.edu/gayme/) and [Charles Meneveau](http://pages.jh.edu/~cmeneve1/) at the Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on developing wind farm control algorithms to increase wind energy integration in electric power systems.
