# Work Experience
**AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow**
*U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC*
*September 2020 -- Present*

**Postdoctoral Fellow**
*Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD*
*October 2018 -- August 2020*
Worked under Professors Charles Meneveau and Dennice Gayme on vortex models for yawed wind turbines, thermal stratification in wind farms, and wind turbine price arbitrage potential using aerodynamic energy storage.

**Research Assistant**
*Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD*
*September 2013 -- September 2018*
Worked under Professors Charles Meneveau and Dennice Gayme on modeling and control of wind farms for grid support applications. Develop simple time-dependent wind-turbine wake models and model-based controllers for  power grid secondary frequency regulation.

**Building Systems Engineer**
*Steven Winter Associates, Norwalk, CT*
*January 2011 -- July 2013*
Conducted research funded by the Department of Energy on advanced energy technologies in residential buildings through the Building America program. Provided educational outreach to building contractors, energy consultants, utilities, and homeowners to promote energy efficiency best practices in residential buildings.

**System Advisor Model Intern**
*National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO*
*July 2010 -- November 2010*
Developed and implemented algorithm to model backtracking for single-axis tracking photovoltaic systems in System Advisor Model. Implemented shading algorithms for PV systems and solar water heating performance models.

**DAAD RISE Intern**
*Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics, Kassel, Germany*
*May 2009 -- August 2009*
Constructed a dynamic model of a district heating system for a neighborhood in Kassel. Ran simulations to assess the optimal design and determine the exergy and efficiency savings of using waste heat from the district heating system.
