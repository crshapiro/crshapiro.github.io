Before we even moved into our house in late 2018, we planted bulbs --- daffodils, crocuses, alliums, and hyacinth --- and two climbing roses. Moving and unpacking could wait. Preparing for spring flowers was top priority. For the roses, I chose two fragrant repeat bloomers with prolific blooms. Pink New Dawn for the front and yellow Golden Gate along a fence in the back. After a year to establish themselves, both bloomed just as we settled into the new pandemic lifestyle. In contrast to the New Dawn's flowering flush, the Golden Gate bolted to the sky with only a few blooms at the top.

Disappointed by the Golden Gates' blooming, I waited until the winter to try to encourage more blooming the next year. I tied the rose branches to be more horizontal and pruned off excess canes that would crowd the rose in the next growing season.

Both roses have not disappointed this year with their prolific blooms. The Golden Gate is still sprouting vigorous canes from the base. Unsure what to do, I have resorted to pruning off long canes without blooms.
