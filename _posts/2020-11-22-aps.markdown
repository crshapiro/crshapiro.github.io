**Abstract**
Yawed wind turbines generate a counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) that deflects and deforms the turbine's wake downstream. Informed by large eddy simulations (LES) of yawed wind turbines in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the airplane trailing vortex literature, we develop a model for the shed vorticity and circulation of the CVP. Analytical integration of a simplified form of the vorticity transport equation yields analytical equations that do not require costly numerical integration. We apply an eddy-viscosity model with the ABL friction velocity and width of the vortex sheets representing the velocity and length scales, respectively. Comparisons of the analytical model to LES measurements of the maximum vorticity and circulation magnitude show considerable agreement. These results indicate that cross-diffusion dominates the CVP decay as the vorticity cancels along the wake's line of symmetry.

**Introduction**
Yawing has potential to increase or control wind farm power output, and yawed wind turbine wakes have interesting characteristics.

**Counter-rotating vortex pair**
Large eddy simulations (LES) of wind turbines in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) show that yawed wind turbines shed a counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) in their wake. The CVP begins as arcs of vorticity that diffuse downstream to become nearly axisymmetric, as shown in the interactive vorticity volume rendering below.

**Generation of the CVP**
The initial distribution of vorticity in the CVP of a wind turbine yawed at an angle $$\gamma$$ with a thrust coefficient $$C_T$$ can be found by solving the linearized mean streamwise vorticity transport equation
\\[U_\infty \frac{\partial \omega_x}{\partial x} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial f_y}{\partial z} \\]
for the streamwise vorticity
\\[\omega_x(x,r,\theta) = -\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}} C_T U_\infty \cos^2\gamma \,\sin \gamma \sin \theta \,\, \delta(r-R) H(x).\\]
This solution yields a total circulation that is identical to the previously proposed lifting line theory
$$\Gamma_0 = RC_T U_\infty \cos^2 \gamma \sin \gamma$$. This vorticity distribution and the corresponding velocity field analytically derived from the Biot-Savart law agrees well with simulations, as shown below.

**Generation of the CVP**
We find that the CVP decays downstream of the turbine through cross-diffusion, where the vorticity is government by the advection-diffusion equation

\\[U_\infty \frac{\partial \omega_x}{\partial x} = \nu_T(x) \left( \frac{\partial^2 \omega_x}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \omega_x}{\partial z^2}\right)\\].

Direct integration yields analytic equations for the circulation
\\[\frac{ \Gamma(x) }{\Gamma_0}= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4}\frac{R}{\eta(x)} \exp\left( - \frac{R^2}{8\eta^2(x)}\right)\left[ I_0\left( \frac{R^2}{8\eta^2(x)}\right) + I_1\left( \frac{R^2}{8\eta^2(x)}\right)\right]\\]
and maximum vorticity
\\[\omega_\mathrm{max}(x) =
\label{eq:max-vorticity}
 \frac{\Gamma_0}{4 \eta^2(x)} \exp\left( - \frac{R^2}{2\eta^2(x)}\right) I_1\left( \frac{R^2}{2\eta^2(x)}\right)\\]
 that depends on the squared eddy-diffusive length scale
 \\[\eta^2(x) = \frac{1}{U_\infty} \int_{x_0}^x \nu_T(x') \, dx'.\\]
 Assuming an eddy-viscosity $$\nu_T(x) = \upsilon(x) \ell(x)$$, where the velocity scale is the friction velocity $$\upsilon(x) = u_*$$ and the length scale grows linearly downstream $$\ell(x) = 2kx$$ at a rate $$k = u_* / U_\infty$$, fully specifies the model. Comparison of the model theory to LES shows good agreement and collapse when scaled by the rotor radius and initial circulation strength.

**Conclusion**
We have developed a theoretical model that describes the generation and decay of the CVP behind yawed wind turbines and agrees well with simulations.
